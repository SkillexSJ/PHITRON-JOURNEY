   Example for n = 10,000: 1 operation

2. O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
   Best Case: Logarithmic Time
   Worst Case: Logarithmic Time
   Example for n = 10,000: ~14 operations

3. O(√n) - Square Root Time
   Best Case: Square Root Time
   Worst Case: Square Root Time
   Example for n = 10,000: ~100 operations

4. O(n) - Linear Time
   Best Case: Linear Time
   Worst Case: Linear Time
   Example for n = 10,000: 10,000 operations

5. O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time
   Best Case: Linearithmic Time
   Worst Case: Linearithmic Time
   Example for n = 10,000: ~140,000 operations

6. O(n²) - Quadratic Time
   Best Case: Quadratic Time
